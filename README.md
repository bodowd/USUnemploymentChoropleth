At the end of the semester for the data science course I took, we made choropleth maps. I built upon that project to create my own choropleth map to look at how unemployment rates have changed since I graduated high school in 2008.

I was surprised by the amount of blue (decrease in unemployment rates) I had on the map because when I listen to the radio, it seemed like unemployment is generally a big complaint. Maybe the unemployment was just really bad in 2008, and maybe now it's just "ok" bad. I expected more states to look like West Virginia or New Mexico. I was most surprised by Michigan's decrease in unemployment rate.
My initial thought was "I must have made an error", so I double checked my data to make sure I didn't mess something up during data manipulation. That seemed ok. I searched to verify this has been noticed by others, and it has.

Then, I was curious about the change in the labor force between 2008 and 2015. I was wondering if people without jobs were moving away, while people who still had their jobs stayed around. This would make unemployment rate decrease. This doesn't account for people who stopped looking for work though.

From the data below, it seems that the labor force is increasing in some cities. The blue counties in North Dakota overlap with where the Bakken shale is, where oil fracking is done. With the oil fracking came alot of workers.
