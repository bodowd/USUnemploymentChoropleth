At the end of the semester for the data science course I took, we made choropleth maps. I built upon that project to create my own choropleth map to look at how unemployment rates have changed since I graduated high school in 2008.

With everything I hear about the economy, I was surprised by the amount of blue (decrease in unemployment rates) I had on the map. Maybe the unemployment was just really bad in 2008, and maybe now it's just bad. I expected more states to look like West Virginia or New Mexico. I was surprised by the amount of blue in Idaho and Montana, but I was most surprised by Michigan's decrease in unemployment rate.
My initial thought was "I must have made an error", so I double checked my data to make sure I didn't mess something up during data manipulation. That seemed ok. I googled to verify this has been noticed by others, and it has.

For a future analysis, I want to look at the change in the size of the labor forces in the different states. I'm curous about where people might be moving from and moving to.
